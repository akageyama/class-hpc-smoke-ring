# class-hpc-smoke-ring

A simple sample field solver, or a CFD (Computational Fluid Dynamics)
code for the class "HPC", which is for undergraduate students of
Department of Engineering, Kobe University, Japan.

## Physical Model
A gas contained in a rectangular box is driven by a localized force
near a side plane of the box. The force drives the gas fluid toward
the other side, rsulting in the formation of well-known vortex-ring,
or smoke-ring.

## Program structure

    --+--src (For the smoke-ring simulation. The output is a file
      |       named "_data_slice".)
      |
      +--slice_grapher (For visualization. It reads "_data_slice"
      |                 and makes an animated gif of the flow in a
      |                 a cross section.)
      |
      +--warming_up (A supplementary, simple, sample, and stand-alone,
                     simulation program. It solves 1-D Burgers
                     equation with the same numerical scheme (finite
                     difference + Runge-Kutta integration) and with
                     the same visualization method (gnuplot). Read
                     and run this program before you proceed to the
                     main smoke-ring ring codes (src and slice_grapher).

## Prerequisite

- Fortran 2003 compiler, for the simulation.
- gnuplot and ImageMagic (convert command), for the visualization.
- An animated gif viewer. Here we use Safari.

## Usage

    1. cd src
    2. make  (for simulation)
    3. cd ../slice_grapher
    4. make (for visualization)

## Easy experiments

- Change the grid size (NX,NY,NZ) in src/constants.f90
- Change dissipation params in src/params.namelist


## Basic equation

Compressible Navier-Stokes equations for an ideal gas.


## Numerical method

Second-order central difference with 4-th order Runge-Kutta integration.

## Boundary condition

Periodic boundary in all (three) dimensions.

## Programing language

Fortran 2003.
